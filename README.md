# FoodRecipeApp

Welcome to FoodRecipeApp, a mobile application designed to provide users with access to a wide variety of recipes. This Android app is built using Java and Android Studio, leveraging the power of the Spoonacular API for retrieving recipe data. Retrofit is utilized for making HTTP requests to the API, and GSON is used for parsing JSON responses.

## Features
- Search for recipes based on various criteria such as ingredients, cuisine, diet, etc.
- View detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, nutritional facts, and more.
- Save favorite recipes for easy access later.
- Share recipes with friends and family via social media or messaging platforms.
